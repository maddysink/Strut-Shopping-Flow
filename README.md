# Strut-Shopping-Flow

# Summary
This is a checkout flow incorportating micro-interactions for a shoe store app I created called 'Strut' for my Innovative Technologies for Design Course

# About
I created this checkout flow using Figma and some open source designs as the base.  I then significantly modified the open source components to fit my specific product: a mobile application for a shoe and accessory store called Strut.  Some of the modifications I made helped the components better align with WCAG2 accessibility standards and overall creating a more cohesive design.  The the first microinteraction I incorportated into this flow was an animated heart button to "favorite" a product.  My favorite interaction I created was when users tap "add to cart", the product moves across the screen and into the cart, while the number of cart items increases simultaneously.  I also added a springy animated bottom sheet so users can view their cart directly from the product page that users can exit with a downwards dragging motion. The last animation I added is during the checkout screens, where an animated progress bar shows users their stage of the checkout process.  As users progress through the checkout screens, each stage transitions from unfilled to filled.

# Reflection
I am really happy with this project and how it turned out.  I learned how to animate the product moving across the screen into the cart, which is something I have been wanting to learn how to do and implement into my digital experiences for a while now! Additionally, it was really interesting to think of microinteractions in terms of an actual user flow, this made the interaction design feel more meaningful and practically applied.  These past two projects have completely opened my eyes to all the possibilies of adding animation and purposeful movement into a user experience. I feel that I have grown immensely as a UX designer in such a short period of time, as this was not something I had previously thought possible on Figma, nor something that I should learn how to do as an early career UX designer.  However, I am so so so happy.  I can truly see the growth within myself and my work.  I would love to continue to build on these skills to really stand out in the world of UX.
